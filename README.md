> The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard. As it accelerates, it deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution.

[**Image Explorer**](https://jwyg.github.io/image-explorer/) is a set of browser-based tools for the visual exploration of image collections.

# ü•û Image Stack

Enables the creation of an "image stack" from a set of image URLs.

Follows from recent work on "composite images" (Pearce et al, 2018; Niederer & Colombo, 2019).

* [Demo](https://jwyg.github.io/image-explorer/image-stack)
* [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/jwyg/image-explorer/blob/gh-pages/image-stack/sketch.js)
* [Code on P5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/jwyg/sketches/vmGk8vbAU)

# üçπ Image Blend

Enables the creation of an "image blend" from a set of image URLs, including experimentation with [different P5 blend modes](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/blend).

* [Demo](https://jwyg.github.io/image-explorer/image-blend)

# üç± Image Grid

*To do: Enables the creation of an "image grid" from a set of image URLs, including the display of a larger version of the image on click/rollover. See [roadmap](https://github.com/jwyg/image-explorer/projects/1).*

# üéí How to use

## üò∏ On Github

You can use on the web at <https://jwyg.github.io/image-explorer/> (*to do: enable import of image URLs*)

## üßÆ On P5 web editor

You can run on [P5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/jwyg/sketches/l34CpRlNO), where you can login/create an account and duplicate and customise the code to add your own URLs and change variables.

## üì¶ Download and run locally

You can [download](https://github.com/jwyg/image-explorer/archive/gh-pages.zip) the [repository](https://github.com/jwyg/image-explorer), modify P5 files and open using a web browser.

## üç¥Fork the code on GitHub

You can [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [repository](https://github.com/jwyg/image-explorer), modify accordingly, preview using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and suggest changes with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

# üêô Inspiration, acknowledgments and contributors

Image Explorer is inspired by recent work on [visual methods](https://www.zotero.org/groups/visual_methods) in the context of internet studies and new media research. It is created using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and intended to work alongside other web-based tools and libraries for repurposing web and social media data such as those from the [Digital Methods Initiative](https://tools.digitalmethods.net/) and the [m√©dialab, Sciences Po, Paris](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/).

The project was prompted by a set of [visual methods recipes](http://recipes.publicdatalab.org/) from [Gabriele Colombo](https://densitydesign.org/person/gabriele-colombo/) drawing on his doctoral work exploring the [design of composite images](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/141266). These recipes were documented and refined for a module on [Digital Methods for Internet Studies: Concepts, Devices and Data](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/modules/level7/7aavdm28) convened by [Liliana Bounegru](https://lilianabounegru.org/) and [Jonathan Gray](http://jonathangray.org/) at the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh), [King's College London](http://kcl.ac.uk/), leading to a set of collaborative group projects with their students and the [European Forest Institute](https://www.efi.int/). The approaches behind these recipes draw on several years of experimentation with images in the context of research and teaching at the [Visual Methodologies Collective](https://visualmethodologies.org/) (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences), the [Digital Methods Initiative](http://digitalmethods.net/) (University of Amsterdam), [DensityDesign Lab](https://densitydesign.org/) (Politecnico di Milano), the [m√©dialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/) (Sciences Po, Paris) and beyond. You can read more about this in the readings listed below, in particular [Colombo, 2019](https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/1075861/340493/phd2019_Rampino_Mariani_Colombo.pdf); [Niederer, 2018](http://ojs.uc.cl/index.php/Disena/article/view/151); and [Niederer & Colombo, 2019](http://ojs.uc.cl/index.php/Disena/article/view/151).

This initial prototype was developed by [Jonathan Gray](http://jonathangray.org/) thanks to support from the [Arts & Humanities Research Institute](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ahri) at [King's College London](http://kcl.ac.uk/) and through collaborations and conversations with [Gabriele Colombo](https://densitydesign.org/person/gabriele-colombo/), [Liliana Bounegru](https://lilianabounegru.org/) and [Michele Mauri](https://densitydesign.org/person/michele-mauri/).
